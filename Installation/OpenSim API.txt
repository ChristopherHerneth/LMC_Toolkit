- module _simbody not found:
    ----use OpenSim 4.2
    2. add C:\OpenSim4.2\sdk\Python to PYTHONPATH (make sure there are no spaces in the name)
    3. add C:\OpenSim4.2\bin to path (make sure it appears before any other open sim environment)
    4. install openSim api according to the instructions in the website (4.2)
    ------------------------
    ----use OpenSim 4.4
    2. delete OpenSim 4.2 from python path
    3. delete OpenSim 4.2 from path or at least move below opensim 4.4
    4. Download the Anaconda environment file (conda_env.yml) https://simtk-confluence.stanford.edu:8443/download/attachments/29165295/conda_env.yml?version=1&modificationDate=1643835525076&api=v2 and place it directory of your choice (conveniently in C:\OpenSim4.4\sdk\Python
    5. open an Anaconda powershell
    6. conda init cmd.exe
    7. cd C:\OpenSim4.4\sdk\Python
    8. conda env create -f conda_env.yml
    9. conda activate opensim_scripting
    10. python setup_win_python38.py (it is here C:\OpenSim4.4\sdk\Python)
    11. python -m pip install . ( the dot is important)
    11.5. step necessary on amartyas machine: conda install - opensim-org opensim
    12. to use OpenSim 4.4 in a python script there must be the following lines before importing opensim:
        import os
        os.add_dll_directory("C:/OpenSim4.4/bin") # or however the location is called on your PC

    -> moco problem not solved yet conda install -c opensim-org opensim-moco

- scale tool doesnt work
    use absolute path to required files. Otherwise the tool returns an error

- InverKinematicsSolver throws an error that the number or type of input is wrong:
    this is probably because you are using OpenSim 4.2 and the c++ is expecting a pointer
    i couldnt solve this problem. Use openSim 4.4 as that function implements call by value as well

- RuntimeError: std::exception in 'bool OpenSim::InverseDynamicsTool::run()': InverseDynamicsTool Failed, please see messages window for details...
    check the ID settings file. Is there a model name or does the field say unassigned?
    If the xml file was created by the GUI then the file will be unassigned and the solver does not know whch model to load

- AttributeError: module 'os' has no attribute 'add_dll_directory'
    are you using the correct environment? OpenSim44? This error usually occurs if opensim is not installed in that environment

- runtÂ´timeError: std::exception in 'void OpenSim__AssemblySolver::track(SimTK::State &)': AssemblySolver::track() attempt failed.
  THE IK solver throws an error: try closing opensim if its open in the background and restarting the PC
  try a different marker set and test it in the OpenSim GUI

- tree error with massless bodies
  The problem is the ground to throrax joint. The original is a CustomJoint, which works fine.
  If we replace it with a FreeJoint problems arise
